# Student-Waitlist
A waitlist system which makes use of LinkedStack and Stack implementation

Course Registration System
Overview:
The Course Registration System is a Java program designed to manage the registration process for a course. It allows students to be added to a waitlist, tracks their registration status, and simulates various registration scenarios.

Features:
Student Management: Students can be added to the waitlist with their name and student number.
Registration Status: Each student's registration status (waitlisted or permitted to register) is tracked.
Days Left for Registration: Students are provided with a certain number of days to register before their status changes.
Simulation: The program simulates registration operations, such as adding students, removing them from the waitlist, and checking their registration status.
Custom Data Structures: The program uses custom data structures like Circular Doubly Linked List to efficiently manage student data.
Usage
Compilation: Compile all Java files in the project using a Java compiler.

javac *.java
Run the Driver Program: Run the StudentDriver class to execute the program.

java StudentDriver

Follow Instructions: The program will prompt you to interact with the course registration system. Follow the instructions to add students, perform registration operations, and simulate the registration process.

Classes
Student: Represents a student with a name and student number.
WaitlistedStudent: Extends the Student class and adds registration status and days left for registration.
CircularDoublyLinkedList: Implements a circular doubly linked list to store students on the waitlist.
CourseWaitlist: Manages the course waitlist and simulates the registration process.
LinkedStack: Implements a stack data structure using a singly linked list.
Status: Enumeration representing the status of a student's registration.
StudentDriver: Main driver program to demonstrate the functionality of the system.
